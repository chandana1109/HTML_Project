    <p>Although it consists of almost 7,000 islands, most of Japan’s main sights and tourist attractions can be found on Hokkaido, Honshu, Kyushu, and Shikoku. These are the four largest of them. <br>Lying to the east of mainland Asia, the island nation is a fascinating place as old and new collide wherever you go. While the futuristic metropolises of Tokyo and Yokohama are full of skyscrapers and neon lights, Kyoto and Nara instead boast traditional palaces and age-old temples. <br>  
    Covered in mountains and forests, the country is also home to some delightful nature and scenery. This explains why the vast majority of its large population is found in the densely populated cities that hug its long and indented coastline.

            <p>The symbol of Kamakura is the approximately 11-meter tall (not including its pedestal), 13th-century bronze statue of Amida Buddha , in Kotoku-in Temple. Initially housed in a huge wooden hall, it was restored in the Edo period (1603-1868) after being damaged over the years by typhoons and earthquakes. Today it is the most popular site in Kamakura as well as the second largest seated Buddha in the country.

            <p>Osaka is only a short shinkansen ride from Tokyo, but has a very different personality to Japan's capital city.
